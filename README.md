## Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (Version 12 or later)
- Yarn package manager
- Angular CLI

## Installing Yarn (\*\*only if not installed already)

The Yarn maintainers recommend installing Yarn globally by using the NPM package manager, which is included by default with all Node.js installations. Use the -g flag with npm install to do this:

```bash
sudo npm install -g yarn
```

After the package installs, have the yarn command print its own version number. This will let you verify it was installed properly:

```bash
yarn --version
```
